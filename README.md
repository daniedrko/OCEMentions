This is a code for an analysis piece I wrote regarding responses to Rep. Goodlatte and a controversial amendment he introduced. 

On the evening of Jan. 2, just before the 115th Congress officially started its term, a House GOP Conference proposed to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics, spurring a lot of anger from politicians and constituents. I took to Twitter mentions, specifically of Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) to consider the idea.
